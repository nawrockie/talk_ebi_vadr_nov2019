Reference-based viral sequence annotation using VADR

Abstract: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thousands to millions of sequences of well studied human pathogenic
viruses, such as HIV, Influenza, Dengue virus, and Norovirus, exist in
publicly available databases like GenBank and ENA. In GenBank, many of
these sequences, with the exception of Influenza sequences, are not
consistently or thoroughly annotated with all known sequence features,
such as mature peptides and structural RNA regions. This is partly due
to the lack of a consistent analysis pipeline for these viral
sequences that could be applied at the time of submission. Influenza
is an exception, for which a specialized annotation tool has been in
use for the past several years at NCBI for influenza sequence
submissions. VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) is a general tool for the
reference-based annotation and validation of viral sequences. Using
probabilistic models (hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and covariance
models (CMs)) of a RefSeq representative a viral species, VADR checks
input sequences for more than 40 different types of potential
problems, including early stop codons and regions of low similarity to
the RefSeq, and maps the RefSeq model annotation onto each sequence
via an alignment of the sequence to the RefSeq. VADR uses information
on the secondary structure of the reference model, when available, to
inform the alignment, and can annotate any feature from the reference
model down to a length of one nucleotide. At NCBI, VADR is currently
in use for the analysis of incoming Norovirus and Dengue virus
sequences. VADR is a general framework that can be extended to use
alignments of reference sequences instead of single sequences, and
could be useful for the validation and annotation of any conserved
sequence family or sequence feature with length up to about 20Kb. At
NCBI, we are currently testing alignment-based VADR models on the
automatic validation of incoming sequence submissions of the popular
metazoan marker gene cytochrome c oxidase 1 (Cox1), with the hope of
eventually extending its use to other commonly submitted marker genes.

Outline:
- Background 
  - GenBank is big (counts from GenBank paper)
  - Sequence submissions are handled by NCBI experts
  - Virus table
- one-model-per-feature strategy 
  - worked fine for norovirus but not for dengue 
  - examples of norovirus
  - examples of dengue failures
- one-model-per-genome strategy
  [summary of paper]
  - 4 stages
  - comparison with VAPiD and VIGOR
  - alerts, alert table
  - structural RNAs in Dengue
- marker genes
- conclusion: 
  - similar to xfam but looks for specific errors that 
    profile methods (hmmer/infernal) assume are not there. assumption
    is that observed sequence is non-artifactual
- future directions
  o alignments
  o profile-based protein validation replacing blastx
  o HMMER4: memory efficient alignment

Following from 00NOTES.txt in my jan 2019 job talk for nlm.

<[(stats-on-cox1)]> pwd
/panfs/pan1/infernal/notebook/19_1103_talk_ebi_vadr/stats-on-cox1

<[(stats-on-cox1)]> perl make-qsub-cox1.pl > qsub-cox1.sh
<[(stats-on-cox1)]> sh qsub-cox1.sh 
<[(stats-on-cox1)]> cat COX1*all*all*ntlist > all.COX1.ntlist
<[(stats-on-cox1)]> cat COX1*2018*all*ntlist > all.COX1.2018.ntlist

That didn't really work, at least the 2018 returned weird
errors. Instead of figuring out why I decided to just use Entrez;

Searched for 'cox1' (that's it) in Nucleotide:
1,349,957 hits

And in 2018:
Searced for 'cox1 AND 2018/01/01:2018/12/31 [Publication Date]'

Trying to count how many Zika sequences have mature peptide
information for a stat in my talk.

First I need to get a list of all Zika seqs.
Then I have a script in the paper supp tarball that counts number with
mature peptides.

Getting list of all zika seqs:
<[(stats-on-zika)]> pwd
/panfs/pan1/infernal/notebook/19_1103_talk_ebi_vadr/stats-on-zika
<[(stats-on-zika)]> cp $INF/notebook/19_0103_talk_nlm_interview/stats-on-popular-genes/make-qsub-flu.pl ./
<[(stats-on-zika)]> cp make-qsub-flu.pl make-qsub-zika.pl
<[(stats-on-zika)]> cat zika-query.sh
esearch -db nuccore -query "txid64320[Organism:exp]" | efetch -format acc > zika.all.ntlist
# this returns 1719 seqs
# an independent Entrez search for "zika virus" in nucleotide returns 2959 but if 
# you look at 'top organisms' only 1717 are in Zika Virus (788 are synthetic construct)
<[(stats-on-zika)]> sh zika-query.sh
<[(stats-on-zika)]> wc -l zika.all.ntlist 
1719 zika.all.ntlist

How many of these have mature peptides annotated?
<[(stats-on-zika)]> cp $INF/notebook/19_1003_vadr_mscript_tests3/m-vadr/vadr-1.0-paper-supplementary-material/scripts/genbank-fetch-cds-and-mp.sh .
<[(stats-on-zika)]> cp $INF/notebook/19_1003_vadr_mscript_tests3/m-vadr/vadr-1.0-paper-supplementary-material/scripts/genbank-count-cds-and-mp.sh .
<[(stats-on-zika)]> cp $INF/notebook/19_1003_vadr_mscript_tests3/m-vadr/vadr-1.0-paper-supplementary-material/scripts/acclist2mp-and-cds.pl .
<[(stats-on-zika)]> sh count-zika-cds-and-mp.sh
num seqs with >= 1 CDS annotated: 1442
num seqs with >= 1 mat_peptide annotated: 370

1442/1719 = 83.886%
370/1442 = 25.6% 


----------------
Counting RNAs:

Testing on NC_001477 which I know has RNAs
<[(stats-on-zika)]> esearch -db nuccore -query \"NC_001477.1\" | efetch -format gpc | xtract -insd ncRNA INSDFeature_location
NC_001477.1	10320..10735
NC_001477.1	10393..10735
NC_001477.1	10463..10735
NC_001477.1	10551..10735
<[(stats-on-zika)]> esearch -db nuccore -query \"NC_001477.1\" | efetch -format gpc | xtract -insd stem_loop INSDFeature_location
NC_001477.1	2..69
NC_001477.1	79..93
NC_001477.1	114..130
NC_001477.1	10324..10389
NC_001477.1	10397..10458
NC_001477.1	10467..10549
NC_001477.1	10551..10633
NC_001477.1	10643..10656
NC_001477.1	10657..10735

Now doing the same for all viruses in my table.

<[(stats-on-top-viruses)]> pwd
/panfs/pan1/infernal/notebook/19_1103_talk_ebi_vadr/stats-on-top-viruses
<[(stats-on-top-viruses)]> perl make-qsub.pl > run.sh

This runs each virus in serial:
<[(stats-on-top-viruses)]> sh run.sh

Now pulling out cds, mp, rna, stem_loop feature counts:
<[(stats-on-top-viruses)]> pwd
/panfs/pan1/infernal/notebook/19_1103_talk_ebi_vadr/stats-on-top-viruses
<[(stats-on-top-viruses)]> cat count-all-features.sh
for f in CDS mat_peptide stem_loop ncRNA; do 
    for v in HIV-1 flu-A HCV HepB flu-B rotavirus SIV norovirus entero-A PRRSV dengue RSV entero-B rabies westnile measles; do 
        perl ./acclist2feature-type.pl $v.all.ntlist $f > $v.$f.all.out
        perl ./acclist2feature-type.pl $v.2018.ntlist $f > $v.$f.2018.out
        echo -n "num $v all seqs with >= 1 $f annotated: "
        cat $v.$f.all.out | awk '{ print $1 }' | sort | uniq | wc -l
        echo -n "num $v 2018 seqs with >= 1 $f annotated: "
        cat $v.$f.2018.out | awk '{ print $1 }' | sort | uniq | wc -l
    done
done

    

<[(stats-on-top-viruses)]> sh count-all-features.sh

-------------------------------
Ideas:

- add posterior probability example, (at feature endpoint)?
- add diagram showing software used by VADR:
  infernal, hmmer, easel, bio-easel, blastx, sequip

==========================
EPN, Mon Nov 11 05:57:27 2019

run through:

Definitely:
DONE - figure out if/where to put slide with rejected seqs going straight
  back to submitter
- per-annotation-stage slides: combine the two bullet points into 1
- flesh out 'slow' in limitationas
- verify vapid and vigor error bullet points should be identical
- 5' turncationed vapid vadr slide
- cox1
- brush up on Zika rna structure terms (download paper)

Maybe:
- slide showing software used by vadr (I think I have this in my 2014
  NCBI job talk
- percent identity zika and other viruses (get stats)
- slide that shows how to map alignment to sequence? Annotate with
  posterior probabilities
- outline slides?
- per virus annotations into table? (PROBABLY NOT)
  

12 min to lack of mp annotation
17 min to submission slide with vadr box
42 min to vapid

===========================
EPN, Tue Nov 12 04:40:34 2019

7 min to virus list
15 min to virus list with red
30 min to end of stages

- blank slide before virus list?
- git update dnaorg talks
- vapid: 'complete viral genomes'
- cox1: emphasize modesl built from alignments
- limiations comma after representative
