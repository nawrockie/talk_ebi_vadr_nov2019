\section*{Competing interests}
  The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

\section*{Author's contributions}

AAS wrote the protein validation module and EPN wrote the remainder of
the code. ELH updated RefSeq annotation and developed test cases. LY
tested the software on sequence submissions and developed test
cases. LS wrote an early version of the classification module. JRB and
IK-M helped develop the initial specifications for VADR and managed
the work of ELH and LY, respectively. AAS and EPN conceived of and
designed the software and wrote the paper. All authors helped in the
development of the software and read and approved the final
manuscript.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

We thank Est\'eban Finol for providing predicted RNA structures for
the Dengue virus RefSeqs, Alex Kotliarov for incorporating VADR into
the GenBank submission portal system, and Ron Patterson and his team
for managing NCBI's computing resources. This research was supported

Medicine and National Cancer Institute.
